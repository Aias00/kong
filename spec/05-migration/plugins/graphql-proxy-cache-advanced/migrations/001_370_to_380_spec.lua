-- The: '001_370_to_370' migration deprecates redis.timeout in plugin configuration.
-- However redis support for graphql-proxy-cache-advanced was introduced in 3.7 whereas
-- the upgrade tests start at 2.8 or 3.4. So there's no way to setup the plugin with redis_options
-- config in version 3.7 (with timeout field) and verify if the migration to 3.8 works.
-- However the redis config is shared across various plugins and the migration code was tested there:
-- (rate-limiting-advanced, graphql-rate-limiting-advanced, proxy-cache-advanced)
