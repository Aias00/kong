## Why Kong?

If you are building for the web, mobile, or IoT (Internet of Things) you will
likely end up needing common functionality to run your actual software. Kong
can help by acting as a gateway (or a sidecar) for microservices requests while
providing load balancing, logging, authentication, rate-limiting,
transformations, and more through plugins.


**Kong** or **Kong API Gateway** is a cloud-native, platform-agnostic, scalable API Gateway distinguished for its high performance and extensibility via plugins.

By providing functionality for proxying, routing, load balancing, health checking, authentication (and [more](#features)), Kong serves as the central layer for orchestrating microservices or conventional API traffic with ease.

Kong runs natively on Kubernetes thanks to its official [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller).

---

- **Cloud-Native**: Platform agnostic, Kong can run on any platform - from bare
  metal to containers - and it can run on every cloud natively.
- **Kubernetes-Native**: Declaratively configure Kong with native Kubernetes CRDs
  using the official Ingress Controller to route and connect all L4 + L7 traffic.
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Load balance traffic across multiple upstream
  services.
- **Hash-based Load Balancing**: Load balance with consistent hashing/sticky
  sessions.
- **Circuit-Breaker**: Intelligent tracking of unhealthy upstream services.
- **Health Checks:** Active and passive monitoring of your upstream services.
- **Service Discovery**: Resolve SRV records in third-party DNS resolvers like
  Consul.
- **Serverless**: Invoke and secure AWS Lambda or OpenWhisk functions directly
  from Kong.
- **WebSockets**: Communicate to your upstream services via WebSockets.
- **gRPC**: Communicate to your gRPC services and observe your traffic with logging
  and observability plugins
- **OAuth2.0**: Easily add OAuth2.0 authentication to your APIs.
- **Logging**: Log requests and responses to your system over HTTP, TCP, UDP,
  or to disk.
- **Security**: ACL, Bot detection, allow/deny IPs, etc...
- **Syslog**: Logging to System log.
- **SSL**: Setup a Specific SSL Certificate for an underlying service or API.
- **Monitoring**: Live monitoring provides key load and performance server
  metrics.
- **Forward Proxy**: Make Kong connect to intermediary transparent HTTP proxies.
- **Authentications**: HMAC, JWT, Basic, and more.
- **Rate-limiting**: Block and throttle requests based on many variables.
- **Transformations**: Add, remove, or manipulate HTTP requests and responses.
- **Caching**: Cache and serve responses at the proxy layer.
- **CLI**: Control your Kong cluster from the command line.
- **REST API**: Kong can be operated with its RESTful API for maximum
  flexibility.
- **Geo-Replicated**: Configs are always up-to-date across different regions.
- **Failure Detection & Recovery**: Kong is unaffected if one of your Cassandra
  nodes goes down.
- **Clustering**: All Kong nodes auto-join the cluster keeping their config
  updated across nodes.
- **Scalability**: Distributed by nature, Kong scales horizontally by simply
  adding nodes.
- **Performance**: Kong handles load with ease by scaling and using NGINX at
  the core.
- **Plugins**: Extendable architecture for adding functionality to Kong and
  APIs.

## Development

We encourage community contributions to Kong. To make sure it is a smooth
experience (both for you and for the Kong team), please read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md),
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [COPYRIGHT](COPYRIGHT) before
you start.

If you are planning on developing on Kong, you'll need a development
installation. The `master` branch holds the latest unreleased source code.

You can read more about writing your own plugins in the [Plugin Development
Guide](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/plugin-development/), or browse an
online version of Kong's source code documentation in the [Plugin Development
Kit (PDK) Reference](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/pdk/).

For a quick start with custom plugin development, check out [Pongo](https://github.com/Kong/kong-pongo)
and the [plugin template](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin) explained in detail below.

#### Docker

You can use Docker / docker-compose and a mounted volume to develop Kong by
following the instructions on [Kong/kong-build-tools](https://github.com/Kong/kong-build-tools#developing-kong).

#### Kong Gojira

[Gojira](https://github.com/Kong/gojira) is a CLI that uses docker-compose
internally to make the necessary setup of containers to get all
dependencies needed to run a particular branch of Kong locally, as well
as easily switching across versions, configurations and dependencies. It
has support for running Kong in Hybrid (CP/DP) mode, testing migrations,
running a Kong cluster, among other [features](https://github.com/Kong/gojira/blob/master/doc/manual.md).

#### Kong Pongo

[Pongo](https://github.com/Kong/kong-pongo) is another CLI like Gojira,
but specific for plugin development. It is docker-compose based and will
create local test environments including all dependencies. Core features
are running tests, integrated linter, config initialization, CI support,
and custom dependencies.

#### Kong Plugin Template

The [plugin template](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin) provides a basic
plugin and is considered a best-practices plugin repository. When writing
custom plugins we strongly suggest you start by using this repository as a
starting point. It contains the proper file structures, configuration files,
and CI setup to get up and running quickly. This repository seamlessly
integrates with [Pongo](https://github.com/Kong/kong-pongo).

#### Vagrant

You can use a Vagrant box running Kong and Postgres that you can find at
[Kong/kong-vagrant](https://github.com/Kong/kong-vagrant).

#### Source Install

Kong mostly is an OpenResty application made of Lua source files, but also
requires some additional third-party dependencies. We recommend installing
those by following the source install instructions at
https://docs.konghq.com/install/source/.

Instead of following the second step (Install Kong), clone this repository
and install the latest Lua sources instead of the currently released ones:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Kong/kong
$ cd kong/

# you might want to switch to the development branch. See CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git checkout master

# install the Lua sources
$ luarocks make
```

## Getting Started

Let’s test drive Kong by adding authentication to an API in under 5 minutes.

We suggest using the docker-compose distribution via the instructions below, but there is also a [docker installation](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/install/docker/#install-kong-gateway-in-db-less-mode) procedure if you’d prefer to run the Kong API Gateway in DB-less mode.

Whether you’re running in the cloud, on bare metal, or using containers, you can find every supported distribution on our [official installation](https://konghq.com/install/#kong-community) page.

1) To start, clone the Docker repository and navigate to the compose folder.
```cmd
  $ git clone https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong
  $ cd docker-kong/compose/
```

2) Start the Gateway stack using:
```cmd
  $ KONG_DATABASE=postgres docker-compose --profile database up
```

The Gateway will be available on the following ports on localhost:

`:8000` on which Kong listens for incoming HTTP traffic from your clients, and forwards it to your upstream services.
`:8001` on which the Admin API used to configure Kong listens.

Next, follow the [quick start guide](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/getting-started/configuring-a-service/
) to tour the Gateway features.

## Features

By centralizing common API functionality across all your organization's services, the Kong API Gateway creates more freedom for engineering teams to focus on the challenges that matter most.

The top Kong features include:
- Advanced routing, load balancing, health checking - all configurable via a RESTful admin API or declarative configuration.
- Authentication and authorization for APIs using methods like JWT, basic auth, OAuth, ACLs and more.
- Proxy, SSL/TLS termination, and connectivity support for L4 or L7 traffic.
- Plugins for enforcing traffic controls, rate limiting, req/res transformations, logging, monitoring and including a plugin developer hub.
- Sophisticated deployment models like Declarative Databaseless Deployment and Hybrid Deployment (control plane/data plane separation) without any vendor lock-in.
- Native [ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller) support for serving Kubernetes.
