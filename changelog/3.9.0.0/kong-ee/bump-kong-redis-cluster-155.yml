  Bumped `kong-redis-cluster` to `1.5.5`.

  1. Currently, the timeout for acquiring a lock is fixed to `5s`.
     We added a new option `lock_timeout` to make it configurable.
  2. The lock timeout parameter was incorrectly set to `time_out = 0`.
     We fix it to `timeout = 0`. This would improve perf as there is no
     need for each instance to refresh the slots.
  3. Returned detailed error message to downstream
     component (e.g. Kong Gateway) for better debuggability.
