### Performance
#### Performance

- Bumped the concurrency range of the lua-resty-timer-ng library from [32, 256] to [512, 2048].
 [#7880](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/7880)
 [KAG-2932](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-2932) [KAG-3452](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3452)

- Cooperatively yield when building statistics of routes to reduce the impact to proxy path latency.
 [#7266](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/7266)

#### Configuration

- Bump `dns_stale_ttl` default to 1 hour so stale DNS record can be used for longer time in case of resolver downtime.
 [#7529](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/7529)
 [KAG-3080](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3080)

- Bumped default values of `nginx_http_keepalive_requests` and `upstream_keepalive_max_requests` to `10000`. These changes are optimized to work better in systems with high throughput. In a low-throughput setting, these new settings may have visible effects in loadbalancing - it can take more requests to start using all the upstreams than before.
 [#7663](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/7663)
 [KAG-3360](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3360)
#### Core

 [#7380](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/7380)
 [KAG-3169](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3169)

### Breaking Changes
#### Core

- **BREAKING:** To avoid ambiguity with other Wasm-related nginx.conf directives, the prefix for Wasm `shm_kv` nginx.conf directives was changed from `nginx_wasm_shm_` to `nginx_wasm_shm_kv_`
 [#7160](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/7160)

- The listing endpoints for consumer groups (`/consumer_groups`) and consumers (`/consumers`) now respond
  with paginated results. The JSON key for the list has been changed to `data` instead of `consumer_groups`
  or `consumers`.
  [#6421](https://github.com/Kong/kong-ee/issues/6421)
  [FTI-5336](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/FTI-5336) [FTI-5359](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/FTI-5359)

- In OpenSSL 3.2, the default SSL/TLS security level has been changed from 1 to 2.
  Which means security level set to 112 bits of security. As a result
  RSA, DSA and DH keys shorter than 2048 bits and ECC keys shorter than
  224 bits are prohibited. In addition to the level 1 exclusions any cipher
  suite using RC4 is also prohibited. SSL version 3 is also not allowed.
  Compression is disabled.
  [#7714](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/7714)
  [KAG-3459](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3459)

#### Plugin

- **azure-functions**: azure-functions plugin now eliminates upstream/request URI and only use `routeprefix` configuration field to construct request path when requesting Azure API
