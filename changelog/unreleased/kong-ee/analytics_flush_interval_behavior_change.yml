message: |
  The behavior of the configuration option `analytics_flush_interval` has changed
  for saving memory resources by flushing analytics messages more frequently.
  It now controls the maximum time interval between two flushes of
  analytics messages to the configured backend, which means that
  if there are enough (less than `analytics_buffer_size_limit`)
  messages have already been buffered,
  the flush will happen before the configured interval.
  Previously, Kong always tries to flush messages after the configured interval,
  regardless of the number of messages in the buffer.
