  Created connection pool for each `host`, `port`, `username`, `ssl` combination to fix the following issues:

  1. Fixed an 401 error where multiple plugins (e.g. RLA and OIDC) were configured to use different Redis databases.
  2. Prevented malicious clients from gaining access to shared authenticated connections, thus protecting Redis servers.
  3. Restricted clients with limited ACL control to their granted scope.
