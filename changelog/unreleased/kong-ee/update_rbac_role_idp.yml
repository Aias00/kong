message: When authenticating Kong Manager with IDPs (e.g., OIDC, LDAP), the source of an RBAC role will be stored in its `role_source` field, which enables the existing roles with a source of `idp` to be removed upon new logins after IDP role mapping has changed. This also allows users to change a role's source between `local` and `idp` via the Admin API manually.
