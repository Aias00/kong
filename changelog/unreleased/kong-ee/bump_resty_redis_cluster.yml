  Bumped `kong-redis-cluster` to `1.5.4`, fixing the following issues.

  1. Fixed an issue where Kong Gateway cannot recover if partial or all pods were restared with new IPs in Kubernetes environment.
  2. Fixed a memory leak issue where master nodes cache expanded infinitely upon refresh.
  3. Fixed an issue where multiple cluster instances were accidently flushed.
